A lot of the code comes from a great medium article - https://medium.com/@stevehiehn/how-to-generate-music-with-python-the-basics-62e8ea9b99a5

## Transition and Chord Compatibility

The algorithm takes in a text file containing popular chord progressions. From there, it calculates what chords are valid transitions from any other given chord. Given a number of chords, it will generate all possible progressions. You can then select one and it will generate the MIDI file for you to import into your favorite DAW.

## Start point for songs

This algorithm could serve as a tool for forming a start point for a song. You can get a set of chord progressions you are aiming for, select the length, and import the MIDI file.
